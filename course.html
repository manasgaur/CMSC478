                    This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and large language models. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as personalized conversational systems, recommender systems, virtual assistants, autonomous driving, finance, healthcare, and others.

                Concretely, things we expect you to know (we use these constantly, but don’t teach them explicitly). Such as intermediate Python and exposure to algorithms – ability to understand & discuss pseudo-code, and implement in Python.

                You need to make sure your computer and programs work correctly. If your computer breaks down, your internet stops working, or your software isn't compatible, these won't be accepted as valid excuses for missing tests or not turning in assignments.

                    Your work in each part of the course will be scored from 0 to 100. At the end of the semester, we'll multiply each score by its percentage weight from the table and add them all up. This final total will determine what letter grade you get in the class.
                </ul>
            Class participation: Coming to class and taking part in discussions is required. You can earn your 5% participation grade by: Showing up on time, Asking questions, Answering questions during class. 
            If too many students start skipping class, I might give surprise quizzes. If you need special attendance arrangements due to a disability, reach out to the Center for Disability and Access (CDA). They'll work with me to figure out what reasonable accommodations we can make.
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Late Assignments and Regrade Requests</h3>
            <ul>
            Each student will have a total of six late days for use for homework assignments. Once these late days are exhausted, any assignments turned in late will be penalized 20% per late day. However, no assignment will be accepted more than six days after its due date. Each 24 hours or part thereof that a homework is late uses up one full late day. Please note that late days are applied individually. Please keep in mind that late days cannot be applied to any take home mid-term or final exam, if that happens depending upon some unprecendented situation. 
            
            Student will have one to submit a regrade requests by sending an email to the TA.

                        We strongly encourage students to form study groups. Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. Each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by him/herself.

It is an academic integrity violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year, and solutions for related problems. In particular, you may not compare your solutions and code to other students’ or to resources you can find online. If you discuss a problem with others or use an online resource for help, you must cite this in your submission.

Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo. We run plagiarism-detection software on your code against past solutions as well as student submissions from previous years. Additionally, you may not screen share your Overleaf doc or code to other students (including during office hours). Please take the time to familiarize yourself with <a href="https://academicconduct.umbc.edu/">UMBC Academic Integrity Policies</a>.

                        The office of <a href="https://sds.umbc.edu/">Student Disability Services (SDS)</a> works to ensure that students can access and take advantage of UMBC’s educational environment, regardless of disability. From the SDS, UMBC is committed to eliminating discriminatory obstacles that may disadvantage students based on disability. Services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the ADAAA of 2009, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act who request and are eligible for accommodations. The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the UMBC department designated to coordinate accommo- dations that would allow students to have equal access and inclusion in all courses, programs, and activities at the University. If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations, please refer to the <a href="mailto:disAbility@umbc.edu">SDS website</a> for registration information and to begin the process, or alternatively you may visit the SDS office in the Math/Psychology Building, Room 212. For questions or concerns, you may contact us through <a href="disAbility@umbc.edu">email</a> or phone (410) 455-2459. If you require accommodations for this class, make an appointment to meet with me to discuss your SDS-approved accommodations.
